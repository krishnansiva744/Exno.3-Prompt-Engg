### REGISTER NUMBER :212223060264
### Aim: To design an AI-powered chatbot that assists customers in resolving issues related to product troubleshooting, order tracking, and general inquiries. The chatbot should handle various customer queries efficiently while maintaining a conversational and user-friendly tone. In this experiment, we will employ different prompt patterns to guide the development process of the chatbot, ranging from basic task-oriented prompts to more complex, persona-driven prompts.

### Algorithm:  1. Direct Instruction Prompts
Objective: Guide the chatbot to respond concisely to customer inquiries.
Prompt Pattern:
Prompt: "When a customer asks for the status of their order, reply with: 'Your order is currently being processed and will be delivered by [date].'"
2. Contextual Prompting
Objective: Incorporate specific context to provide detailed answers based on the user’s previous interaction.
Prompt Pattern:
Prompt: "If the customer previously mentioned that they haven’t received their order, say, 'I see that you mentioned your order hasn't arrived yet. Let me check the details for you and get back shortly.'"
3. Persona-Based Prompting
Objective: Design the chatbot to adopt a specific persona, making the interaction more engaging.
Prompt Pattern:
Prompt: "Pretend you are a friendly, helpful customer service representative. Use a conversational tone, such as 'Hey there! I’m here to help with any questions you might have. Let’s get your issue sorted!'"
4. Few-Shot Prompting
Objective: Teach the AI how to respond using a few examples, enabling it to generalize for similar situations.
Prompt Pattern:
Prompt: "Here are some examples of how to handle technical questions:
'My phone isn't charging.' → 'Have you tried using a different cable? If that doesn’t work, it may be an issue with the port.'
'The screen is flickering.' → 'It sounds like a display issue. Have you tried restarting the device?'
Now, respond to: 'My app keeps crashing.'"
5. Chain of Thought Prompting
Objective: Use a step-by-step reasoning approach for resolving more complex or technical issues.
Prompt Pattern:
Prompt: "When a customer reports their laptop overheating, guide them through the following steps:
Ask if they are using the laptop on a soft surface.
Suggest moving the laptop to a flat, hard surface for better airflow.
Ask if they’ve cleaned the vents recently.
Recommend restarting the device to see if the issue persists.
Now, solve: 'My laptop fan is making a loud noise.'"
6. Instruction with Constraints
Objective: Instruct the chatbot to provide assistance while adhering to specific constraints (e.g., response length or tone).
Prompt Pattern:
Prompt: "Respond to order inquiries in no more than 50 words and avoid using technical jargon. For example, 'Your order is on the way and should arrive by [date]. Feel free to reach out if you need anything else.'"
7. Reflective Prompting
Objective: Ensure that the chatbot reflects the user’s query back to them before providing a response, reducing misunderstandings.
Prompt Pattern:
Prompt: "When a customer asks for help, first reflect their question back to them. For example, if they ask 'How can I reset my password?' respond with 'You're asking how to reset your password, correct? Here’s how you can do it.'"
Result: The various types of Prompts are executed successfully.
### Step 1: Initial Summary (120–150 words)

Blockchain is a digital ledger system that records transactions securely and transparently across a network of computers. Instead of relying on a central authority, it uses a decentralized structure where each transaction is grouped into a “block,” linked to previous ones, forming a “chain.” This makes data tamper-proof and verifiable by all participants. Blockchain relies on cryptography to ensure data integrity and consensus mechanisms to validate transactions. Key features include transparency, security, and immutability, which make it ideal for applications that require trust and accuracy. While blockchain is widely known for supporting cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, it also has potential in various sectors such as supply chain management, healthcare, and voting systems. By reducing fraud, enhancing security, and eliminating intermediaries, blockchain is transforming how information is shared and trusted across industries.

### Step 2: Revised & Simpler Version (with examples)

Blockchain is a digital system that stores information in small units called “blocks,” which are connected to form a secure “chain.” Once data is recorded, it cannot be changed, making the system trustworthy and safe from tampering. Unlike traditional systems, blockchain does not depend on a single authority; instead, many computers share and verify the information, ensuring transparency.

One popular use of blockchain is in cryptocurrencies like **Bitcoin**, where it keeps track of all transactions securely. Another example is **supply chain tracking**, where companies use blockchain to confirm the origin and movement of products, such as ensuring food is fresh or goods are genuine. Its key benefits are security, transparency, and reliability, making it useful in many areas beyond digital money.

### **Quick Revision Notes (50–60 words)**

Blockchain is a secure digital ledger where data is stored in connected “blocks” and shared across many computers, making it tamper-proof and transparent. It is used in **Bitcoin** (digital currency transactions), **supply chain tracking** (verifying product origin), and other areas like healthcare and voting. Key benefits: security, trust, and decentralization.

### **Detailed Version (150–200 words, 3–4 examples)**

Blockchain is a digital system that records information in small units called “blocks,” which are linked together to form an unchangeable “chain.” This structure ensures that once data is entered, it cannot be altered, providing high levels of security and trust. Instead of relying on one central authority, blockchain uses a network of computers to verify and store transactions, making it transparent and resistant to fraud.

A well-known application is **cryptocurrency**, such as Bitcoin, where blockchain keeps a secure and transparent record of all transactions. In **supply chain management**, it helps track products from their origin to delivery, ensuring authenticity and quality. In **healthcare**, blockchain stores medical records securely and shares them only with authorized users. Additionally, **voting systems** can use blockchain to create tamper-proof, transparent elections.

By ensuring data security, transparency, and efficiency, blockchain is transforming industries beyond digital money, including finance, healthcare, and logistics.
